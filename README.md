<h3><u><strong><i>Ordinal Raffle</i></strong></u> &nbsp;(Bitcoin)</h3>
<hr />
Users can participate in Ordinal Raffle by sending 1000 PSAT per ticket to “Deposit Address”.
If counter down starts and user is winner, he will get the inscription, but if he is a loser, he lost all, and can't be refunded.

I developed this project front end with React, and the backend with Node.js.

- The Features
  - Minting
  - Hunting
  - Buying and Selling on NFT Marketplace
  - Smart Claim System
  - Reincarnation

- The Challenge
  - Faced the secret problem - Random Number Generation in the smart contract.
  - By using Chainlink, made the perfect Random Number in the smart contract and protected the attacks from hackers.

- The Problem
  - Play-To-Earn NFT games typically fail when their economies become unsustainable. This usually happens when established players hoard ever-lasting NFTs, and start withdrawing rewards in bulk without contributing anything back. Without enough new players joining, the economy stagnates: All the rewards have been eaten up by whales, with little incentives left for everybody else. This is when game creators tend to panic and impose knee-jerk measures that catch remaining players off guard, damaging trust and making a bad situation worse.

- The Solution
  - Crypto Legions has invented a 'Play Forever Earn Forever' system, consisting of a combination of innovative updates including our Transparent Economy Status, our Smart Claim System™, our proven Omni-Balanced Oracle™ System, our Reserve Pool™, and our Reincarnation™ process. The combination of these features allows players to keep playing forever and to give birth to a new token, whenever needed and voted by the players who are taking the decision to Reincarnate based on the transparently provided data of the economy status. To fully understand the power of this system, you need to go over all the features in detail in this whitepaper.
