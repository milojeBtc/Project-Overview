<h3><u><strong><i>Ordinal Raffle</i></strong></u> &nbsp;(Bitcoin)</h3>
<hr />
Users can participate in Ordinal Raffle by sending 1000 PSAT per ticket to “Deposit Address”.
If counter down starts and user is winner, he will get the inscription, but if he is a loser, he lost all, and can't be refunded.

I developed this project front end with React, and the backend with Node.js.
